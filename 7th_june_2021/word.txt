Now, look at lines 32 and 33. The iterator refers to members called first and second--what are those? maps play a trick on you by using another class template to store your name value pairs: the pair class template defined in <utility> (included by <map> already). If you are iterating through the items stored in a map, you will be pointing to pair objects. Working with pairs is simple, the first item in a pair is stored in the first member, and the second is stored in, well, second.
